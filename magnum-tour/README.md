# Magnum Tour

This example goes through creating a magnum cluster using
terraform and connecting to it.
We assume the existance of a template created by your
OpenStack operator.

Next we give you an overview of what to expect from the default
template offered on IRIS Scientific OpenStack clouds.
This includes looking at the built in monitoring and load balancing.

Finally we look at exposing servers via ingress.
